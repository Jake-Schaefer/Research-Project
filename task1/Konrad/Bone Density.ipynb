Robust Multiarray Algorithm was used to normalize the expression data and smoking-related genes were analyzed using two-way ANOVA under mutiple-testing adjustment combined with our previous GEO data (GSE7429).\"\n"]}],"source":["background_prefixes = ['!Series_title', '!Series_summary', '!Series_overall_design']\n","clinical_prefixes = ['!Sample_geo_accession',
