To establish genomic pathogenesis of RP, we performed the microarray analysis for comparing the gene expressions among renal papillary RP and normal tissue of 23 CaOx and 6 calcium phosphate (CaP) stone formers, and normal papillary tissue of 7 control patients. Compare to normal papillary tissue, RP tissue contained up-regulation of lipocalin 2, interleukin 11, prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 1, glutathione peroxidase 3, and monocyte to macrophage differentiation, whereas down-regulation of solute carrier family 12 member 1  and sodium leak channel non selective (either > 2.0- or 0.5-fold, p <0.01). The network and toxicity analysis showed these genes had association with activated mitogen-activated protein kinase, Akt/ phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathway, and pro-inflammatory cytokines, which caused renal injury and oxidative stress.\"\n","!Series_overall_design\t\"Human renal papillary tip tissues were biopsied during endoscopic kidney stone surgery.

Vitamin D supplementation has been proposed as a strategy to improve muscle function in older adults. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of calcifediol (25-hydroxycholecalciferol) on whole genome gene expression in skeletal muscle of vitamin D deficient frail older adults. A double-blind placebo controlled trial was conducted in vitamin D deficient frail older adults (aged above 65), characterized by blood 25-hydroxycholecalciferol concentrations between 20 and 50 nmol/L. Subjects were randomized across the placebo group (n=12) and the calcifediol group (n=10, 10 µg per day). Muscle biopsies were obtained before and after six months of calcifediol or placebo supplementation and subjected to whole genome gene expression profiling using Affymetrix HuGene 2.1ST arrays. Expression of the vitamin D receptor gene was virtually undetectable in human skeletal muscle biopsies. Calcifediol supplementation led to a significant increase in blood 25-hydroxycholecalciferol levels compared to the placebo group. No difference between treatment groups was observed on strength outcomes. The whole transcriptome effects of calcifediol and placebo were very weak. Correcting for multiple testing using false discovery rate did not yield any differentially expressed genes using any sensible cut-offs. P-values were uniformly distributed across all genes, suggesting that low p-values are likely to be false positives. Partial least squares-discriminant analysis and principle component analysis was unable to separate treatment groups. Calcifediol supplementation did not affect the skeletal muscle transcriptome in frail older adults. Our findings indicate that vitamin D supplementation has no effects on skeletal muscle gene expression, suggesting that skeletal muscle may not be a direct target of vitamin D in older adults.\"\\n!Series_overall_design\\t\"Microarray analysis was performed on skeletal muscle biopsies (m. vastus lateralis) from vitamin D deficient frail older adults before and after supplementation with 25-hydroxycholecalciferol.\"\\n\\nSample characteristics dictionary (from \"!Sample_characteristics_ch1\", converted to a Python dictionary that stores the unique values for each field):\\n{0: [\\'tissue: muscle\\'], 1: [\\'Sex: Male\\', \\'Sex: Female\\'], 2: [\\'subject id: 3087\\', \\'subject id: 3088\\', \\'subject id: 3090\\', \\'subject id: 3106\\', \\'subject id: 3178\\', \\'subject id: 3241\\', \\'subject id: 3258\\', \\'subject id: 3279\\', \\'subject id: 3283\\', \\'subject id: 3295\\', \\'subject id: 3322\\', \\'subject id: 3341\\', \\'subject id: 3360\\', \\'subject id: 3361\\', \\'subject id: 3375\\', \\'subject id: 3410\\', \\'subject id: 3430\\', \\'subject id: 3498\\', \\'subject id: 3516\\', \\'subject id: 3614\\', \\'subject id: 3695\\', \\'subject id: 3731\\'], 3: [\\'intervention group: 25-hydroxycholecalciferol (25(OH)D3)\\', \\'intervention group: Placebo\\'], 4: [\\'time of sampling: before intervention (baseline)\\', \\'time of sampling: after intervention\\']}\\n'"],"application/vnd.google.colaboratory.intrinsic+json":{"type":"string"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":40}],"source":["f'''As a biomedical research team, we are selecting datasets to study the association between the human trait \\'{TRAIT}\\' and genetic factors, optionally considering the influence of age and gender.
