Participants in a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, active-controlled study examining response to FA alone and in combination with statin were genotyped for candidate SNPs. Genomic DNA extracted from peripheral blood was genotyped using a custom GoldenGate bead array encompassing 384 SNPs (Illumina). Multivariate linear regression and 2-way ANOVA for percent change in apoC-III level were performed between the groups receiving FA alone compared with FA+statin compared with statin alone.\"\n"]}],"source":["background_prefixes = ['!Series_title', '!Series_summary', '!Series_overall_design']\n","clinical_prefixes = ['!Sample_geo_accession',

After searching the GEO database and parsing the matrix file of a series, we obtained background information and sample characteristics data. We will provide textual information about the dataset background, and a Python dictionary storing a list of unique values for each field of the sample characteristics data. Please carefully review the provided information and answer the following questions about this dataset:\\n1. Does this dataset contain gene expression data? (Note: Pure miRNA data is not suitable.)\\n2. For each of the traits \\'High-Density Lipoprotein Deficiency\\', \\'age\\', and \\'gender\\', please address these points:\\n   (1) Is there human data available for this trait?\\n   (2) If so, identify the key in the sample characteristics dictionary where unique values of this trait is recorded. The key is an integer. The trait information might be explicitly recorded, or can be inferred from the field with some biomedical knowledge or understanding about the data collection process.\\n   (3) Choose an appropriate data type (either \\'continuous\\' or \\'binary\\') for each trait. Write a Python function to convert any given value of the trait to this data type.

Mixed dyslipidemia, characterized by elevated triglyceride and apoC-III levels and low HDL cholesterol level, with or without elevated LDL cholesterol, increases cardiovascular disease risk and is commonly treated with combined statin and fibrate therapy. We sought to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with apoC-III level response to combination therapy with statins and fenofibric acid (FA) in individuals with mixed dyslipidemia. Participants in a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, active-controlled study examining response to FA alone and in combination with statin were genotyped for candidate SNPs.

Participants in a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, active-controlled study examining response to FA alone and in combination with statin were genotyped for candidate SNPs. Genomic DNA extracted from peripheral blood was genotyped using a custom GoldenGate bead array encompassing 384 SNPs (Illumina). Multivariate linear regression and 2-way ANOVA for percent change in apoC-III level were performed between the groups receiving FA alone compared with FA+statin compared with statin
